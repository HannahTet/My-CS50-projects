This project is the LinguaApp, a demo version of the multifunctional application for learning languages.
The installation is not required because the application is the exe file.
Everything you need is to download the file to your computer. Save it in the desired derictory, and then use it.
Nevertheless, if you want to download all the files of the application, there is a version of the exe file with its package.
